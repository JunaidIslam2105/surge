## What is Surge?

Surge is designed for power users who prefer a keyboard-driven workflow. It features a beautiful **Terminal User Interface (TUI)**, as well as a background **Headless Server** and a **CLI tool** for automation.

## Why use Surge?

Most browsers open a single connection for a download. Surge opens multiple (up to 32), splits the file, and downloads chunks in parallel. But we take it a step further:

- **Smart "Work Stealing":** If a fast worker finishes its chunk, it doesn't sit idle. It "steals" work from slower workers to ensure the download finishes as fast as physics allows.
- **Slow Worker Restart:** We monitor mean speeds. If a worker is lagging (< 0.3x average), Surge kills it and restarts the connection to find a faster route.
- **Daemon Architecture:** Surge runs a single background "engine." You can open 10 different terminal tabs and queue downloads; they all funnel into one efficient manager.
- **Beautiful TUI:** Built with Bubble Tea & Lipgloss, it looks good while it works.

## Usage

Surge has two main modes: **TUI (Interactive)** and **Server (Headless)**.

### 1. The Interactive TUI

Just run `surge` to enter the dashboard. This is where you can visualize progress, manage the queue, and see the speed graphs.

```bash
# Start the TUI
surge

# Start TUI with downloads queued
surge https://example.com/file1.zip https://example.com/file2.zip

# Combine URLs and batch file
surge https://example.com/file.zip --batch urls.txt

# Start without resuming paused downloads
surge --no-resume

# Auto-exit when all downloads complete
surge https://example.com/file.zip --exit-when-done
```

### 2. Adding Downloads

Use `surge add` to queue downloads to a running instance (TUI or Server).

```bash
# Add a download to running instance
surge add https://example.com/file.zip

# Add multiple downloads
surge add https://a.com/1.zip https://b.com/2.zip

# Batch add from file
surge add --batch urls.txt

# Save to a specific folder
surge add https://example.com/file.zip -o ~/Downloads/ISO
```

> **Note:** `surge get` is an alias for `surge add`.

### 3. Server Mode (Headless)

Great for servers, Raspberry Pis, or background processes.

```bash
# Start the server
surge server start

# Start with downloads queued
surge server start https://example.com/file1.zip https://example.com/file2.zip

# Combine URLs and batch file
surge server start https://example.com/file.zip --batch urls.txt

# Start on a specific port
surge server start --port 8090

# Auto-exit when all downloads complete
surge server start --exit-when-done https://example.com/file.zip

# Start without resuming paused downloads
surge server start --no-resume

# Check server status
surge server status

# Stop the server
surge server stop
```

### 4. Managing Downloads

Control downloads directly from the CLI:

```bash
# List all downloads
surge ls
surge ls --json    # JSON output
surge ls --watch   # Live updates

# Pause downloads
surge pause <ID>
surge pause --all

# Resume downloads
surge resume <ID>
surge resume --all

# Remove downloads
surge rm <ID>
surge rm --clean   # Remove all completed
```

> **Tip:** `surge kill` is an alias for `surge rm`.

## Benchmarks

We tested Surge against standard tools. Because of our connection optimization logic, Surge significantly outperforms single-connection tools.

| Tool      | Time       | Speed          | Comparison   |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| **Surge** | **28.93s** | **35.40 MB/s** | **—**        |
| aria2c    | 40.04s     | 25.57 MB/s     | 1.38× slower |
| curl      | 57.57s     | 17.79 MB/s     | 1.99× slower |
| wget      | 61.81s     | 16.57 MB/s     | 2.14× slower |

> _Test details: 1GB file, Windows 11, Ryzen 5 5600X, 360 Mbps Network. Results averaged over 5 runs._

We would love to see you benchmark surge on your system!

## Browser Extension

The Surge extension intercepts browser downloads and sends them straight to your terminal.

- **Chrome / Edge:** Enable "Developer Mode" in extensions and load the `extension-chrome` folder unpacked.
- **Firefox:** [Get the Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/surge/)
